% The following code allows your computer to process audio signals in
% MATLAB in real time. This was developed for use with the ECEn 487 class
% in the Winter 2013 semester.
%
% This code serves as a "wrapper" to set up the propper i/o handshaking
% between MATLAB and the PCs sound card.  You place your code inside the
% buffer loop where it says % Put your dsp code or function call here! %
% Note that real-time operation without data drop outs or queue overflow
% depends on the processor not being too busy with other tasks, so starting
% other programs, popping between windows, etc. will couse some data loss.

% These are important parameters for your sound card. They specify the
% sample rate and essentially the size of the block of data that you will
% periodically receive from the sound card.
SampleRate = 8000;
FrameSize = 8192;


% The real meat of the code is here. The reason that this is all preceded
% by a "try" statement is that when an error occurs, MATLAB will release
% the system resources that control the sound card. Otherwise, you often
% have to restart MATLAB.
try % VERY IMPORTANT

    set(ap, 'QueueDuration', 0.3);

    ar = dsp.AudioRecorder;
    set(ar, 'DeviceDataType', '16-bit integer');
    set(ar, 'SamplesPerFrame', FrameSize);

    disp('Starting processing');

        y_data = input_data;
        
        
        %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
        step(ap, y_data);
        input_data = step(ar);        
    end
    disp('>>>>Stopped processing');
    % You want to make sure that you release the system resources after using
    % them and they don't get tied up.
    release(ar)
    release(ap)

    % The following statements are really important so that you don't cause
    % problems and hang system resources when you actually terminate inside of
    % the loop. Otherwise, you need to restart MATLAB if you hit certain kinds
    % of errors.
    catch err

        release(ap)
